## Exercises:

1. Give a recursive definition of the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ that
    contain at least one $b$ and have an even number of $a$’s before the
    first $b$.
    For example: $aab$, $bab$ and $aaaabbabababa$ are in the set,
    but $abb$, $aaab$ and $aa$ are not

    _**SOLUTION:**_

    I. Base Caese: The very base word we can have in this language is to only have a $b$.
    Thus we deduce that $b \in L$.

    II. Recursive Step: 

    We know then that any number of even $a$ before a $b$ can also form part of the language:
        
    $aau \in L$ for all $u \in L$.

    Furthermore, any $a$ or $b$ can be a part of the language if it comes after another $b$. Thus:

    $ua, ub \in L.$ 

    III. Closure:

    We then infer that any word $v$ can be defined in the form $ua, ub or aau$, given $u \in L$. 


2. Let $X = \{aa, bb\}$ and $Y = \{\lambda, b, ab\}$.

    a. List the strings in set $XY$

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|-|-|-|-|-
    1|aa|2|aab|3|aaab
    4|bb|5|bbb|6|bbab

    b. How many strings of length 6 are there in $X^*$?

    Within $X^*$, there are $aaaaaa, aaaabb, aabbaa, aabbbb,bbaaaa, bbaabb, bbbbbb,bbbbaa$. So, a total of 8. (They come from the permutation of all $3X$).


    c. List the strings in set $Y^*$ of length three or less

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|-|-|-|-|-
    1|b|2|bab|3|$\lambda$
    4|ab|5|bbb|6|bab
    7|abb|


    d. List the strings in set $X^* Y^*$ of length four or less

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|-|-|-|-|-
    1|$\lambda$|2|b|3|ab
    4|aa|5|bb|6|abb
    7|bab|8|aabb|9|aaaa
    10|bbaa|11|bbbb|12|aaaa


3. Give a recursive definition of the set $\{ a^ib^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 2i\}$

    _**SOLUTION:**_

    I. Basis:

    The base case is when $i = 0$, thus making $j=0$ and $2i = 0$.

    $\implies$ $a^ib^i =a^0b^0 = 1$
    
    There is also 

    $\implies$ $a^ib^i =a^1b^1 = ab$



    II. The recursive case:

    When we want to recurse over the set, 


4. Let $L$ be the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ generated by the recursive
   definition

    **I. Basis:** $b \in L$

    **II. Recursive Step**: If $u \in L$ then $ub \in L$, $uab \in L$, $uba \in
    L$ and $bua \in L$

    **III. Closure**: A string $u \in L$ only if it can be obtained from the
    basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step.

    **a.** List the elements in the sets $L_0, L_1, L_2$


    **b.** Is the string $bbaaba$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced.
    If not, explain why not.


    **c.** Is the string $bbaaaabb$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced.
    If not, explain why not


5. Prove, using induction on the length of a string, that $(w^R)^R = w$ for all
   string $w \in \Sigma$

    _**SOLUTION:**_
